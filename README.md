# Blast
Building a multiplayer game

How to run:

    LINUX
    
        I think i've corrupted the linux sfml lib,
        you can re-download it from here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-linux-gcc-64-bit.tar.gz
        then add it to the game directory, overwriting the SFML2.5.1_linux    

        cmake .
        make
        ./BLAST

    
    Windows
        there is a 'windows release' dir, the BLAST.exe is in there. Just run it
